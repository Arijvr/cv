          I have started my web development journey on 15th September, 2021, and a busy successfully completing Angela Yu's
          complete Web Dev course.
          I am working as a Real Estate Agent and have been doing so since December 2020,
          after leaving my job as a Business Development Manager for a software
          development company.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Over my 12 year career, I have sold many products, initially starting with Gym Memberships, later
    transitioning into software sales and then into selling Real Estate, but I always had a passion
    for technology, and strong interest in code and development.
